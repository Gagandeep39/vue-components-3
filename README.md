## Global Componets

- Components declared in App.js are called global components
- They can be used Anywhere inside application

```js
const app = createApp(App);

app.component('the-header', TheHeader);
app.component('base-badge', BaseBadge);

app.mount('#app');
```

## Local Components

- Componen declared inside another componet is Locl component
- It is accessible from that component only (**Not** even from Child component)

```js
export default {
  components: {
    // Camel Case
    the-header': 'TheHeader',
    // Pascal case
    BaseBadge: BaseBadge,
    // Or simply
    BaseBadge
  }
}
```

- Using pascal case gives us access to `the-header`, `TheHeader` both
- Using `the-header` only allows using `the-header` in html tags
